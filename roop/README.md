Take a video and replace the face in it with a face of your choice. You only need one image of the desired face. No dataset, no training.

You can watch some demos [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KHv8n_rd3Lcr2v7jBq1yPSTWM554Gq8e?usp=sharing).
A Stable Diffusion extension is also available, [here](https://github.com/s0md3v/sd-webui-roop).

## Disclaimer

This software is meant to be a productive contribution to the rapidly growing AI-generated media industry. It will help artists with tasks such as animating a custom character or using the character as a model for clothing etc.

The developers of this software are aware of its possible unethical applications and are committed to take preventative measures against them. It has a built-in check which prevents the program from working on inappropriate media including but not limited to nudity, graphic content, sensitive material such as war footage etc. We will continue to develop this project in the positive direction while adhering to law and ethics. This project may be shut down or include watermarks on the output if requested by law.

Users of this software are expected to use this software responsibly while abiding the local law. If face of a real person is being used, users are suggested to get consent from the concerned person and clearly mention that it is a deepfake when posting content online. Developers of this software will not be responsible for actions of end-users.

## How to install?

### Basic

It is more likely to work on your computer, but will be quite slow. Follow instructions for the basic installation [here](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/1.-Installation).

### Acceleration

If you own a capable GPU and are prepared to address any software problems, you have the option to activate such acceleration, which offers significantly enhanced speed. Once you finished the basic installation, you can follow the instructions for the acceleration installation [here](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/2.-Acceleration).

## How to use?

### UI

Executing `python run.py` command will launch this window:

![gui-demo](gui-demo.png)

Choose a face (image with desired face) and the target image/video (image/video in which you want to replace the face) and click on `Start`. Open file explorer and navigate to the directory you select your output to be in. You will find a directory named `<video_title>` where you can see the frames being swapped in realtime. Once the processing is done, it will create the output file. That's it.

## CLI

Additional command line arguments are given below. To learn out what they do, check the guide [here](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/Advanced-Options).
